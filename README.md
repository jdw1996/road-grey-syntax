## road-grey-syntax

I really like the default One themes for [Atom](https://atom.io/), both
[light](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax) and
[dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax), but I wanted a light theme
whose background wasn't simply white, as I find that hard on my eyes. This
theme uses a grey background and slightly muted colours, as well as a couple
other changes from the One Light syntax theme it's based on.

Here's a screenshot of Road Grey, using the
[Iosevka font](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/):

To install the theme, use the following command from your terminal:
```
$ apm install road-grey-syntax
```

Road Grey theme is also
[available for GNOME Terminal](https://github.com/jdw1996/road-grey-gnome-terminal).
